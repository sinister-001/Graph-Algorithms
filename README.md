# Graph-Algorithms

### In this repository I am going to upload some of the graph algorithms I practiced based on concept inside the algorithms :
### Tarjan Algorithm
### SRTF Algorithm (Shortest Remaining Time First)
### Strongly Connected Components
### Longest Path in DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) and in a Tree
### Topological Sorting


This zip folder contains all the codes with CLion Files
